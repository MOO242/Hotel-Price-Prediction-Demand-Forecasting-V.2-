# End to End Hotel Price Forecasting V2** — an upgraded version of my earlier project

If V1 was about the *what* (predicting hotel prices), V2 is all about the *how*: building a production‑grade, modular, and scalable pipeline behind the scenes.

The challenge:

Forecasting the next 90 days of hotel pricing while applying real MLOps principles and clean software architecture.

What’s new in V2:

- **Flexible Data Ingestion:** Transitioning from flat files to SQL and MongoDB
- **Robust Pipelines:** Centralized logging, custom exception handling, and modular components
- **AWS Integration:** Fully deployed on the cloud for real‑world scalability

Learning to build systems this way has been a game‑changer.
